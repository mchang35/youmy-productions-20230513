Notes:
 * Generally, it takes a while (at least 2-3 minutes) for the connection between the js file and the HTML file to work.
 * For the GALLERY:
    * DONE
      * Likely will have to use javascript to get this going
      * put all photos into a list or something
      * also have a part that displays the current picture largely
      * currently selected picture has a border around it or something
      * wraparound for photos (if we reach the end, we wrap around back to the beginning)
    * Still to do:
      * have a next and previous button - done BUT not in the correct place
 * DONE (general):
   * Place previous and next buttons for gallery in correct spot -- solution: I took the selected photo and prev and next buttons out of the columns and put them into a single div.
   * place the big logo in the correct place (direct middle)
   * adjust for PHONE/smaller screens
 * FONT: Rustic Printed (for ALL text)
